Here is the Update Request: 

Hi Dabil

I notice you are already thinking about improvemnts to gaterling for leagues (showing players registered during the season) but would it also be possible to maybe have a box under the upcoming events on the homepage for "ongoing leagues" so once the event has started gatherling still advertises it for the duration.

Thanks

Chris
