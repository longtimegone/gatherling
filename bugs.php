<li> When Creating the next event from the Host CP, the "Allow Pre-Registration" and "Pauper Krew Members Only" options currently do not work. I am troubleshooting this problem now. They will be checked properly on the form that you see but the database is not updated. To enable these options, once the new event is created, just click the "Update Event Info" button to enable these. </li>
